# Ace heroes

## Presentation

Hello world!  
To begin with, my name is *mathis.dlg* and I am student in development and I work on a game named `Ace heroes`

-------------------------------------------

## First of all, what is this game?

This game will be an MMO RPG with a system of Class and Race ultra pushed for the moment there are more than 500 possibilities
and I also wish to add jobs, new race and class for even more customization.  
There should also be a huge map and plots allocated to each player who can improve to have the best village.  
But also clans that can make wars to be the best clan (You can also be pacific).  

In fact this game is made to do what you want without restriction (or almost).

-------------------------------------------

## Reward for helping me

The coders who will help me on this huge project will have of course in game rewards and also their names in the page of the contributors  
For the most useful coders, I think we can do NPC on their behalf.
